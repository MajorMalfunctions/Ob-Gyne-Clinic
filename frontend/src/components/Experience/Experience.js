        are important in monitoring your gynecologic health
        and screening for infection, inflammation or other
        abnormal cells that may indicate disease. Early detection
        is important in treating any disease and especially important
        for cervical cancer and other potentially life-threatening diseases.
        Gynecology involves many areas of women’s healthcare
        “Well Visit” examinations and appropriate in-office laboratory tests
        Osteoporosis assessment using the DEXA Scan equipment
        Mammograms are performed in-office with both 2-D and 3-D technology
        Hormonal Replacement therapy including bioidentical hormones and BioTE pellets
        Surgical treatments performed in the office setting are endometrial ablation, LEEP and hysteroscopy
        Infertility evaluation and limited treatment
        Surgical treatment consultation including minimal invasive hysterectomy, laparoscopic procedures, vaginal surgery and tubal ligation (sterilization)
        Evaluation and treatment of sexual issueswill remove some tissue
        from the cervix to carefully examine as well. An annual exam is one
        of the most important steps you can take in preventing disorders of
        the pelvic organs."

        Making an Informed Decision
        At Woodlands OBGYN Associates, we can help you make an informed decision about birth control. Birth control is used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Many forms of birth control are available today. There are non-permanent and permanent methods available, and you should discuss what methods best meet your family planning needs.

        Learn About Your Birth Control Options
        If you’re not sure when you’ll be ready to have your first child, or if you are not ready to add to your existing family, a non-permanent method such as daily birth control pills, or a Mirena® IUD, would be excellent options for you to discuss with your doctor.

        On the other hand, if you are certain that do not wish to have any more children and are looking for a permanent, non-reversible option, a tubal ligation procedure could be an option for you as well.

        Either way, a candid discussion with your Woodlands OBGYN physician will help guide you to the answer that is right for you, providing you with peace of mind.

        Non-Permanent Birth Control
        For couples who have not yet started their families, or who may be unsure about whether they wish to add to their existing family, non-permanent birth control should be considered in order to prevent pregnancy.  Some of these options include methods.

        Birth Control Pills – Also known as Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs), OCPs are taken by mouth daily and rely on hormones to prevent ovulation in order to prevent pregnancy.
        NUVA Ring® –  This flexible plastic ring is inserted into the vagina and worn 24/7 for the first three weeks of a woman’s menstrual cycle; this method relies on the release of hormones to prevent ovulation, thus reducing the chances of fertilization and pregnancy. Many women appreciate not having to remember to take daily pills with this method.
        Intrauterine Device (IUD) – An IUD is a small device, often “Y” shaped.  Some contain copper or levonorgestrel to prevent ovulation.
        Mirena® IUD (contains progesterone) – A specific type of IUD that is one of the most effective, is made of plastic, and releases hormones to prevent pregnancy. This IUD is effective immediately upon placement in the uterus and remains effective for five years.
        Paragard – An IUD made with copper.
        Nexplanon – A sub-dermal contraceptive implant.

        "The primary symptom of endometriosis is pain, mostly in the lower abdomen, lower back, and pelvic area. Pain associated with endometriosis is usually in tandem with a woman’s monthly menstrual cycle, but in more severe cases, can occur more frequently. The amount of pain a woman feels is not linked to how much endometriosis she has. Some women have no pain even though their disease affects large areas, or there is scarring. Some women, on the other hand, have severe pain even though they have only a few small areas of endometriosis.General symptoms of endometriosis can include, but are not limited to:Painful (or disabling) menstrual cramps; pain may worsen over timeChronic pelvic pain (includes lower back pain and pelvic pain)Pain during or after sexIntestinal painPainful bowel movements or painful urinationHeavy menstrual periodsSpotting or bleeding between periodsInfertilityGastrointestinal symptoms that are like those of a bowel disorderFatigue"

        Laparoscopic surgery is often times called belly button surgery. It is surgery performed through
        small incisions using a specialized telescope typically through the belly button and with smaller
        incisions typically located on the lower abdomen. The laparoscope acts as the eyes and the smaller
        incisions on the lower abdomen act as the surgeon's hands. In this manner were are able to perform
        surgery from diagnostic all the way through to hysterectomy for our patients. The benefit is a faster
        recovery with less pain and better cosmetic results. Although not for all patients, the opportunities
        to perform laparoscopic surgery are expanding all the time. The risks are similar to open surgery but
        with less pain and a faster recovery. Dr. Tabas is a board certified Obstetrician Gynecologist and a
        clinical professor at UCSF and is a skilled laparoscopic surgeon teaching others about the finer points of laparoscopic surgery.

        "At your first visit, blood is drawn and tested for your blood type and Rh factor, blood count (to check for anemia), rubella (to check for exposure to German Measles), as well as tests for syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. You may also need a pap smear. Other tests may be performed at this time as well based on your medical, obstetrical, or family history.When you are (28) weeks into your pregnancy, your blood count for anemia will be rechecked, and you will be screened for gestational diabetes with the one-hour glucola test. If your Rh factor is negative, then you will receive a shot of Rhogam at 28 weeks as well. It is also required that are you retested for HIV and Syphilis at this time.In addition, when you are 36 weeks, we do a vaginal culture to look for Group B Strep. Group B Strep is a bacterium that many women carry in the vagina. It is usually asymptomatic and does not cause any problems but has the potential to cause an infection in a baby. If this test is positive, you will be treated with IV antibiotics during labor.These tests are drawn in our office as a convenience for you and then are sent to a lab facility. The lab we used is Arbor Diagnostics.Many insurance companies specify that you use a specific lab such as Labcorp or Quest. We have an agreement with Arbor Diagnostics that they will honor all tests received as “in network”.Your physician will make recommendations for various tests based on their medical opinion and your specific medical situation.Insurance coverage varies widely and is determined by multiple factors. Because the insurance company guidelines change frequently and can vary from plan to plan, we do not maintain a list of restrictions, policies, or covered benefits.We will provide Arbor Diagnostics with your insurance information so they may bill you for the testing. We have no control over your insurance company in regards to their method of payment, coverage policy, amount of payment, or what amount of payment may be applied deductible or copayments. You will receive a bill from the lab for any amount determined to be your responsibility by your insurance company."

        "A Pap smear test is a preventive measure that can detect precancerous or cancerous cervical cells. A yearly Pap smear used to be recommended for for most women, but this changed in 2013. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommend the following:Pap smear once every years for women under 30.Pap smear and HPV Human Papillomavirus test every 5 years for women under 65.Women over 65 do not need a Pap smear unless there is a history of two or three abnormal test results in the last 5 to 10 years, or if there is a history of dysplasia or cervical cancer.Pap smear and HPV testing is not recommended for girls under 21 years of age. NOTE: These guidelines do not apply to women who have cervical cancer or are positive for HPV and have a weakened immune system.Cervical cancer occurs when the cells in the cervix grow abnormally or out of control. The exact cause of cervical cancer is unknown. Cervix cancer that is identified and treated early is associated with good outcomes. Precancerous cells approach 100% curable.A Pap smear involves obtaining cells from the cervix for examination. It identifies abnormal cellular changes, precancerous cells, or cancerous cells. If the results of your Pap smear are abnormal, your doctor may repeat your Pap smear and conduct additional tests.Certain strains of HPV, a sexually transmitted disease, have been associated with cervical cancer; however, HPV infection usually goes away on its own in younger women. This is why HPV testing is not recommended until the age of 30. A vaccine is available to prevent infection against the two types of HPV that are responsible for the majority of cervical cancer cases and the two types of HPV that are responsible for the majority of genital wart cases."
