    "A million thanks to Dr. Sharon Hontiveros for taking care of me since day 1 until I gave birth. My pregrancy wasnt easy tho, I underwent preterm labor when I was in my 32 weeks thanks God Dr. Sharon was always there who religiously monitors me and my baby. During delivery, Dr. Sharon didn't expect that Shoulder Dystocia would occur according to her it was the scariest condition that could ever happen during delivery. Despite that, Dr. Sharon managed to pull my baby alive! I could really attest and testify how great Dr. Sharon is. She saved my life and my baby. PS My baby weighs 8.3 pounds via normal delivery.",

Eventhough I was in pain in the middle of the night and requested that I’d like to have a CS, she was there to support and look after me and encourage me that I can deliver normally. She always do an extra mile for her patients. So thankful to have known a wonderful OB like Dr. Sharon.",

I can tell she actually cares about me and my health and provides me with answers in a very timely manner. I’m so grateful! Her staff, Maam Princess is so friendly and accommodating.

// margie gayud
// I am very grateful to my OB Doc.Sharon. She's very attentive to me throughout the pregnancy and explains to me very well. I didn't expect that she spent a lot of her time when we were in the labor room for baby's monitoring. With that, my baby was born healthy and alive through emergency CS operation 😊. We may not achieved the ideal plan to have normal delivery but I am so proud for my beautiful and very neat incision 🙏 💕. Thank you so much Doc Sharon! God bless you and your family!

// Rancille Kaye Martel
